- Lsp progress message
- minimalist

my perosnal statusline not support configuration. gitsigns need use my fork version.

Currently I'm losing enthusiasm for making plugins and maintain plugins. Maybe the projects I publish
in the future will no longer support any configuration.

Many of my project codes have been stolen unscrupulously. It's really fucking bad. I don't even get a
little sponsorship to sustain my passion.
